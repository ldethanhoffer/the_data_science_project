\section{the Normal equation}


\noindent In this section, we'll refresh the reader on projections onto images of linear maps: The starting point of this construction is the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:mindist-perp}
	Let $W\subset V$ be a subspace of the inner product space $V$. Let $v \in V$ and $u \in W$.\\
	Then the  following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $(v-u) \perp W$
		\item $	\argmin_{w \in W}\norm{v-w} =u$	
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $w \in W$.\\
	Assuming $u \in W$ satisfies the first condition, we have $v-u \perp u-w$ and by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
	\[
	\norm{v-w}^2 = \norm{v-u}^2+\norm{u-w}^2 \ge \norm{v-u}^2
	\]
	Proving the second condition.\\ 
	Conversely, we assume $u\in W$ satisfies the second condition and apply the following trick:\\
	Consider the function:
	\[
	\phi:\d{R}\mor \d{R}: t \fun \norm{v-u+tw}^2
	\]	
	Since $\norm{v-u}^2$ is minimal, $\phi$ has a minimum at $t=0$. Moreover, $\phi$ is differentiable so that $\phi'(0)=0$. It's also easy to see that
	\[
	\phi(t) = \norm{v-u}^2 +2\cdot t \bl{v-u}{w}+t^2\norm{w}^2
	\]
	Hence $0=\phi'(0) = 2 \bl{v-u}{w}$, and $v-u\perp w$ as required
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:projection}
	Let $W \subset V$ be a  subspace of a finite-dimensional inner product space. Then the map
	\[
	\pi: V\mor W: v \fun \argmin_{w \in W} \norm{v- w}
	\]
	is well defined
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By the above lemma we need to show that for any $v \in V$, there exists a unique $\pi(v) \in W$ such that $v-\pi(v) \perp W$. To this end, we look at the following map $ f \in W^*$
	\[
	f: W \mor \d{R}: w \fun \bl{v}{w}
	\]
	Since $W^*$ is in turn an inner product space, $f$ can be written in the form $\bl{\pi(v)}{-}$ for some unique $\pi(v) \in W$. The result now follows
\end{proof}

The lemma above motivates the following definition:

\begin{definition}\label{def:projection}
	Let $W\subset V$ be a subspace of a finite dimensional inner product space. Then the unique map $\pi: V\mor W$ defined by 
	\[
	\pi(v) \define \argmin_{w \in W}\norm{v-w}
	\]
	is \emph{the projection of $V$ onto $W$}
\end{definition}
\begin{corollary}\label{lem:projcoincide}
	Let $W=\im(f)\ds \im(f)^{\perp}$ and $\pi_{\im(f)}:W\mor \im(f)$ be the canonical projection. Then $\pi_{\im(f)}$ coincides with the projection onto the subspace $\im(f)\subset W$ in the sense of Definition \ref{def:projection}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from \ref{lem:mindist-perp}
\end{proof}
\noindent Next, we consider a linear map $f \in \Hom_\k(U,V)$ and let $W$ be the subspace $\im(f)$. One can give a more explicit description of the projection $\pi: V\mor W$:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:normaleq}
	Let $f \in \Hom(U,V)$ and and $v \in V$ Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	$f(u)$ is the projection of $v$ onto the subspace $\im(f)\subset V$
		\item The vector $u \in U$ satisfies $(f^* \circ f)(u) = f^*(v)$	
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	$f(u)$ is the projection of $v$ onto $\im(f)$ if and only if $\bl{v-f(u)}{f(u')}$ for any $u' \in U$ by Lemma \ref{lem:mindist-perp}. Now,
	\[
	\bl{v-f(u)}{f(u')}=\bl{f^*(v)-f^*f(u)}{u'}
	\]
	This last expression is $0$ if and only if $f^*(v)-f^*f(u)=0$ since the inner product is nondegenerate
\end{proof}

The above lemma justifies the following definition:

\begin{definition}
	Let $f \in \Hom(V,W)$ and $w \in W$.\\ 
	We say that $v \in V$ satisfies the normal equation if and only if 
	\[
	(f^* \circ f)(v) = f^* w
	\]
\end{definition}
In this terminology, we can restate lemma \ref{lem:normaleq} as follows:
\begin{lemma}
	Let $f \in \Hom(V,W)$ and $w \in W$ Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $w =\argmin_{u \in V}\vert \vert w-f(u)\vert \vert$
		\item $v$ is a solution to the normal equation $(f^* \circ f)(v) = f^* w$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\noindent It is finding the solutions to this equation that we are interested in. It turns out that one can give an explicit description of them using the so-called \emph{Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse}. Since this construction seems to be a little less well covered in standard linear algebra literature, we'll discuss in detail below: 
\section{the (Moore-Penrose) Pseudo-inverse}

In this section, we will let $V, W$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces and $f \in \Hom_\d{R}(V,W)$.\\ It is well-known that $f$ does not have an inverse in general. There is however a natural generalization of the notion of inverse which can be defined for \emph{any} map: a \emph{pseudo-inverse}. More precisely, if $f$ either has  a nonzero kernel or if the image of $f$ is not the whole of $W$, then the inverse of $f$ will not exist. One natural way to remediate this issue is to consider complements for both subspaces and write 
\[V\define \ker(f)\ds U_V \textrm{ and } W\define \im(f)\ds U_W\]

It's easy to see that restricting $f$ to appropriate subspaces now does produce an invertible map as follows:

\begin{lemma}
	the map $f: U_V\mor \im(f)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\noindent We'll denote the inverse of $f$ on $U_V$ by $f^\sharp:\im(f)\mor U_V$. A pseudo-inverse is now the natural lift of $f^\sharp$ to the whole of $W$:


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:pseudo-inverse}
	There exists a unique map $f^\sharp:W\mor U_V$ making the following diagram commute:
	\begin{displaymath}
	\xymatrix{
	W\ar[d]_{\pi_{\im(f)}}\ar[drr]^{f^\sharp}\\
	\im(f)\ar[rr]_{f^\sharp} && U_V
	}
	\end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The commutativity of the diagram means that for $u \in U_V$, we have
\[
	f^\sharp(w) \define u\iff f^\sharp(\pi_{\im(f)}(w)) =u\iff \pi_{\im(f)}(w) =f(u)
\]
Where the second equivalence follows from the fact that $f^\sharp$ is the inver of $f$ on $U_V$.\\
The claim will thus follow if we show that the above assignment is indeed a well-defined linear map. To this end assume that $u,u' \in U_V$ satisfy $f(u')=\pi_{\im(f)}(w)=f(u)$.\\ Then $u-u' \in \ker(f)$, hence $u-u' \in \ker(f)\cap U_V$ in particular. Now since $\ker(f)\ds U_V =V$, we have  $u-u'=0$, so that $u=u'$, showing the well-definedness.\\ 
We leave the linearity to the reader.
\end{proof}
It will be helpful to note that the map $f^\sharp\in \Hom(W,V)$ can also be characterized by $\im(f^\sharp)\subset U_V$ and $f\circ f^\sharp =\pi_{\im(f)}$.\\
To give the map $f^\sharp$ a name, we first let $\Lambda(f)$ denote the set
\[
\Lambda(f)\define \{(U_V,U_W)\vert \, \ker(f)\ds U_V=V \textrm{ and } \im(f)\ds U_W =W \}
\]
and conclude from Lemma \ref{lem:pseudo-inverse} that there is a assignment:
\[
\Phi: \Lambda(f)\mor \Hom_\d{R}(W,V):(U_V,U_W)\fun f^\sharp
\]
where $f^\sharp \in \Hom_{\d{R}}(W,V)$ is the unique map satisfying
\[
f \circ f^\sharp = \pi_{\im(f)} \textrm{ and } \im(f^\sharp)\subset U_V
\]
Let's denote the image of $\Phi$ by $\Pi(f)$. Summarizing the discussion, we make the following:
\begin{definition}\label{def:ps}
Let $(U_V,U_W) \in \Lambda(f)$. Then the pseudo-inverse of $(U_V,U_W,f)$ is the map $\Phi(f)$.\\
We say that $g\in \Hom_{\d{R}}(W,V)$ is a pseudo-inverse to $f$ if $g\in \Pi(f)$
\end{definition}

We can give a slightly different description of pseudo-inverses by describing them on the 2 components in the decomposition $\im(f)\ds U_W =W$:


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:pschar2}
Let $(U_V,U_W)$ in $\Lambda(f)$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f^\sharp$ is the pseudo-inverse to $(U_V,U_W,f)$
	\item $f^\sharp\arrowvert_{\im(f)}$ is the inverse to $f:U_V\mor \im(f)$ and $f^\sharp\arrowvert_{U_W}=0$
\end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Since the pseudo=inverse to $(U_V,U_W,f)$ is unique, it suffices to show that the pseudo-inverse indeed satisfies the conditions of $(2)$. The fact that $f^\sharp\arrowvert_{\im(f)}$ is the inverse of $f\arrowvert_{U_V}$ follows from 
	\[
	(f\circ f^\sharp) \arrowvert_{\im(f)}=\big(\pi_{\im(f)}\big)\arrowvert_{\im(f)}=\Id\arrowvert_{\im(f)}
\] 
Moreover, if $w \in U_W$, then $\pi_{\im(f)}(w)=0$ since $\im(f)\ds U_W$. Hence $f^\sharp(w)=f^\sharp(\pi_{\im(f)}(w))=0$ by Lemma \ref{lem:pseudo-inverse}
\end{proof}
Our next order of business is to give an explicit description of the set $\Pi(f)$ of pseudo-inverses to $f$. We begin by showing that we can describe the complements $U_V$ and $U_W$ solely by using the maps $f$ and $f^\sharp$:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:psim-ker}
	Let $f^\sharp$ be the pseudo-inverse to $(U_V,U_W,f)$. Then $U_V=\im(f^\sharp)$ and $U_W=\ker(f^\sharp)$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We have $\im(f^\sharp)\subset U_V$ by Definition \ref{def:ps} . Moreover, $f^\sharp$ is a composition of surjections and hence itself surjective, proving the first claim.\\
	To prove the second claim, note that the second condition of Lemma \ref{lem:pschar2} immediately implies that $U_W\subset \ker(f^\sharp)$. We can also show the other inclusion by assuming that $w\in W$ satisfies $f^\sharp(w)=0$, in which case $\pi_{\im(f)}(w)=f(f^\sharp(w))=f(0)=0$, implying that $w$ lies in the component $U_W$ of the decomposition $\im(f)\ds U_W=W$ as required
\end{proof}

Taking the above lemma one step further allows us to describe the set $\Pi(f)$ of pseudo-inverses as promised:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:charpi}
	Let $f \in \Hom(V,W)$. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $g \in \Pi(f)$
	\item $(f\circ g)\arrowvert_{\im(f)}=\Id$ and $(g\circ f)\arrowvert_{\im(g)}=\Id$ 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $g$ be a pseudo-inverse to $f$ and define $U_V\define\im(g)$ and $U_W\define\ker(f)$. Then Lemma \ref{lem:psim-ker} shows that $g$ is in fact the pseudo-inverse to the triple $\big(U_V,U_W,f\big)$. Now, since $g\arrowvert_{\im_(f)}$ is the inverse to $f\arrowvert_{U_V}$ by Lemma \ref{lem:pschar2}, we have $(f \circ g)\arrowvert_{\im(f)}=\Id$ and $(g \circ f)\arrowvert_{\im(g)}=(g \circ f)\arrowvert_{U_V}=\Id$.\\
	Conversely, assume that $g$ satisfies the conditions in (2).\\
	We begin by showing that $\big(\im(g),\ker(g)\big) \in \Lambda(f)$. Let's show  that $\im(f)\ds \ker(g)=W$ by way of example. Indeed, first note that $\im(f)\cap \ker(g)=0$, as any $w$ in this intersection must satisfy $w=(f\circ g)(w)=f(0)=0$. Moreover, if we write $w=\big(w-f( g(w))\big)+f ( g(w)\big)$, we see that trivially $f(g(w))\in \im (f)$ and \[
	g(w-f(g(w)))=g(w)-(g(f(g(w))=g(w)-g(w)=0
	\]
	so that $\big(w-f(g(w))\big) \in \ker(g)$. This indeed shows that $\im(f)\ds \ker(g)=W$. The proof of $\im(g)\ds \ker(f)=V$ is completely analogous, allowing us to conclude that $(\im(g),\ker(g))\in \Lambda(f)$.\\
	It now remains to show that $g$ is indeed a pseudo-inverse to the triple $(\im(g),\ker(f),f)$. By Lemma \ref{lem:pschar2}, it suffices to show that $g\arrowvert_{\im(f)}$ is the inverse to $f\arrowvert_{\im(g)}$ and that $g\arrowvert_{\ker(g)}=0$. The first claim follows immediately from the fact that $g$ is a left inverse to $f:\im(g)\mor W$ and the second claim is trivial.
\end{proof}

\noindent In order to summarize the previous 2 lemmas, we introduce the following assignment, which is well-defined by Lemma \ref{lem:psim-ker}

\[
\Psi: \Pi(f)\mor \Lambda(f): g\fun \big(\im(g),\ker(g)\big)
\]
We now have:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:psinverses}
	Let $f \in \Hom(V,W)$. Then:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
		$\Pi(f)=\big\{ g \in \Hom(W,V)\,\,\big\vert\,\, (f\circ g)\arrowvert_{\im(f)}=\Id$ \textrm{ and } $(g\circ f)\arrowvert_{\im(g)}=\Id \big\} $
		\item The assignments $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ define 1:1 correspondences between $\Lambda(f)$ and $\Pi(f)$
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
	The first claim simply restates Lemma \ref{lem:charpi}. To prove the second, we note that $\Psi\circ \Phi=\Id$  by Lemma \ref{lem:psim-ker}. Moreover, $\Phi$ is surjective by definition, implying that $\Phi\circ \Psi =\Id$ as well
\end{proof}



\noindent We finish our discussion of pseudo-inverses by discussing a special choice of pseudo-inverse in $\Pi(f)$ that one can make if the vector spaces $V$ and $W$ are equipped with inner products. Indeed, recall the following standard result:

\begin{lemma}
 Let $U \subset V$ be a subspace of a finite dimensional inner product space. Then $U\ds U^{\perp}=V$
\end{lemma}

This leads us to the following Definition:
\begin{definition}\label{def:mpinverse}
Let $V,W$ be finite-dimensional inner product spaces and let $f \in \Hom_\d{R}(V,W)$. Then the \emph{Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse} is the pseudo-inverse to the triple $(\ker(f)^\perp,\im(f)^\perp,f)$.\\ We will denote it by $f^+$
\end{definition}

\noindent It turns out that we can give a very satisfying description of Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverses:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:mppschar}
	Let $V, W$ be finite-dimensional inner product spaces and $f \in \Hom(V,W)$. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $g$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse $f^+$ to $f$
		\item $g$ is a pseudo-inverse to $f$ and $g\circ f$ and $f \circ g$ are self-adjoint linear maps
		\item $f$ and $g$ satisfy $f\circ g \circ f=f$, $g\circ f\circ g =g$,  $(g\circ f)^*=g\circ f$ and $(f\circ g)^* =f\circ g$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The equivalence $(2)\iff (3)$ is simply a restatement of Lemma \ref{lem:psinverses}.\\
	We now prove $(2)\implies (1)$:\\
	Assume that $g$ is a pseudo-inverse to $f$ and that $g\circ f$ and $f \circ g$ are both self-adjoint. then Lemma \ref{lem:psim-ker} implies that $g$ is the pseudo-inverse to the triple $\big(\im(g),\ker(f),f\big)$. The claim will thus follow if we show that $\im(g)=\ker(f)^\perp$ and $\ker(g)=\im(f)^\perp$. By way of example, we will prove the former equality: First note that since $\im(g)\ds \ker(f)=V$, it suffices to show that $\im(g)\perp \ker(f)$. Indeed, for $w \in W$ and $v \in \ker(f)$, we have: 
	\[
	\bl{v}{g(w)}=\bl{v}{(g\circ f)(g(w))}=\bl{(g\circ f)^*(v)}{g(w)}=\bl{(g\circ f)(v)}{g(w)}=\bl{g(0)}{g(w)}=0
	\]
	The proof of $\ker(g)=\im(f)^\perp$ is analogous.\\
	Finally, we show $(1)\implies (2)$:\\
	Assume that $g$ is the Moore Penrose pseudo-inverse to $f$. Ie $g$ is the  pseudo-inverse to the triple $(\ker(f)^\perp,\im(f)^\perp,f)$. We will show that $(f\circ g)$ is self-adjoint and leave the other claim to the reader. To this end, let $v,v' \in V$. Then
	\begin{align*}
	\bl{v}{g(f(v'))}&=\bigg\langle v-g(f(v))+g(f(v)), g(f(v'))-v'+v'\bigg\rangle\\
	&= \bigg\langle v-g(f(v)), g(f(v'))\bigg\rangle+\bigg\langle g(f(v)),g(f(v'))-v'\bigg\rangle+\bigg\langle g(f(v)), v'\bigg\rangle
	\end{align*}
	Now, since $f\circ g\circ f=f$, we conclude that $v-g(f(v))$ and $g(f(v'))-v'$ lie in $\ker(f)$. Moreover, since $\ker(f)=\im(g)^\perp$, we conclude that 
	\[
	\bl{v-g(f(v))}{g(f(v'))}=\bl{g(f(v))}{g(f(v'))-v'}=0
	\]
	So that 
	\[
	\bl{v}{g(f(v'))}=\bl{g(f(v))}{v'}
	\] implying that $f\circ g=(f\circ g)^*$. The equality $g\circ f = (g\circ f)^*$ is completely analogous.
\end{proof}

As mentioned in the introduction of this section, our main motivation for studying the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, is to provide a description of the projection of a vector onto the image of a linear map. We begin with the following preparatory lemma:



\begin{lemma}\label{lem:proj=mppsinverse}
	Let $V,W$ be finite-dimensional inner product spaces and  $f \in \Hom(V,W)$. Let $v \in V$ and $w\in W$. Finally denote the Moore-Penrose inverse of $f$ by $f^+$. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $f(v)$ is the projection of $w$ onto the subspace $\im(f)$
		\item $v$ satisfies the normal equation $(f^*\circ f)(v)=f^*(w)$
		\item $v$ lies in the affine subspace $f^+(w) + \ker(f)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The equivalence of $(1)\iff (2)$ is simply a restatement of Lemma \ref{lem:normaleq}.\\
	To show the equivalence of $(1)\iff (3)$, we first note that $f(f^+w))=\pi_{\im(f)}$, where $\pi_{im(f)}$ is the projection onto the subspace $\im(f)\subset W$ by Lemma \ref{lem:projcoincide}. This shows that the vector $f^+(w) \in V$ indeed satisfies the condition $(1)$. Next, assume (1), so that $v \in V$ satisfies $f(v)=\pi_{\im(f)}(v)$ and write $v= f^+(w)+v'$. Then\[
	f(v)=\pi_{\im(f)(w)}\iff f(f^+(w)+v')=\pi_{\im(f)}(w)\iff \pi_{\im(f)}(w)+f(v')=\pi_{\im(f)}(w)\iff v'\in \ker(f)
	\]
	This proves the claim
\end{proof}

This lemma has an interesting corollary which allows us to write the Moore-Penrose even more explicitly which will play an important role later on:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:psinverse-injective}
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space and $W$ a finite dimensional inner product space. Let $f \in \Hom(V,W)$ be injective and choose \emph{any} inner product on $V$. Then
\[
f^+ = (f^*\circ f)^{-1}\circ f^*
\] 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Since $f$ is injective (so that $\ker(f)=0$), $f^+$ is the pseudo-inverse to the triple $(V,\im(f)^{\perp},f)$ by Definition \ref{def:mpinverse}. It follows immediately that this condition is independent of the inner product on $V$. To prove the formula, simply note that $f^*\circ f$ is invertible if $f$ is injective and apply the second criterium of Lemma \ref{lem:proj=mppsinverse}
\end{proof}
